KEY INSIGHTS
1. Sales by Category
Technology products recorded the highest sales at ₦5.98M, followed by Furniture (₦5.17M) and Office Supplies (₦3.75M).
This indicates strong demand for technology and presents growth opportunities in furniture and office supply segments.

2. Sales by Region
Regions such as West (₦3.59M), Ontario (₦3.06M), and Prairie (₦2.83M) led in sales, showing strong market presence.
In contrast, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon had the lowest sales, indicating potential for targeted marketing or regional expansion.
The top 3 regions account for a significant portion of total revenue.

3. Order Priority vs Shipping Method
Many Critical and High priority orders were shipped using Delivery Truck and Regular Air, rather than Express Air, which is fastest.
This mismatch suggests the need to align shipping modes with order urgency to improve customer satisfaction and delivery speed.

4. Most Valuable Customer by Profit
Emily Phan, purchasing primarily technology products, generated the highest individual profit (₦34,233.99).
Tracking top customers reveals where most revenue comes from, and supports targeted retention and upselling strategies.

5. Bottom 10 Customers by Sales
The lowest 10 customers generated less than ₦500 each, with the lowest being ₦85.72.
This highlights an opportunity to engage low-spending customers through personalized offers or feedback-based reactivation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Boost marketing and sales campaigns focused on Furniture and Office Supplies to grow their share of total revenue.

Increase product and brand awareness in underperforming regions and scale operations in top-performing ones.

Assign Express Air as the default method for Critical and High priority orders to ensure timely delivery.

Offer loyalty incentives or discounts to highly profitable customers to retain and grow valuable accounts.

Develop engagement plans for low-performing customers, including personalized follow-ups or product bundles.
